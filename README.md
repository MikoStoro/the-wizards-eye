#The Wizard's Eye

The game was created as a part of Unity Engine couse at Gdańsk University of Technology. At the end of the course, there was a competition. The game is my entry to this competition.
This was a group project. I am responsible for game design and programming - level design and assssets are NOT MY WORKk. 

This repository does not contain a complete game, as some assets which have been used cannot be uploaded - so this repository is just for documenting the things I learned.
In the repository you can find a demonstration video with a commentary in Polish (which is of somewhat questionable quality).
